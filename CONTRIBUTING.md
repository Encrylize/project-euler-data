Contributing
============
Contributions that either fix or add new problems are very welcome.
Since all the original descriptions are from
[EulerPy](https://github.com/iKevinY/EulerPy), the guidelines for formatting
are mostly the same for the sake of consistency:

* Keep the width of each line to 74 characters maximum.
* Align centered text with the 74 character width in mind.
* If the problem links to a resource, ensure that the file exists in the
  `resources` directory and that it is part of the list.
* If the problem contains an image, use the format `[Image: image name]` where
  the image would normally be.

The main challenge in adding new problems is replacing the LaTeX-formatted
mathematical equations with easily readable plaintext.

Problems also occasionally get updated to reflect an increase in computing
power, which means that existing problems will also occasionally have to be
updated with new answers and slight changes in descriptions.
