Project Euler Data
==================
This repository contains information for the first 330 problems on
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) in JSON format.
Each problem description has been formatted into easily readable plain text
(courtesy of [EulerPy](https://github.com/iKevinY/EulerPy)).
This makes it ideal for things such as terminal applications and other
environments where HTML and JavaScript is not available.

Each problem has the following data:

* ID
* Name
* Description
* Difficulty
* Answer

Problems with extra attachments (text files, images) also have an additional
`resources` attribute containing filenames for these.
Said resources can be found in the `resources` directory.

================
All problem descriptions are courtesy of the
[EulerPy](https://github.com/iKevinY/EulerPy) project, which has done great
work formatting the descriptions from Kyle Keen's
[Local Euler](http://kmkeen.com/local-euler) project into a more human-friendly
form.
